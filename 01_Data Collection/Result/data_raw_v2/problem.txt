sth. goes wrong with data craping
--> cannot select some months correctly（feburary, september for example）
(the version of webdriver ?)

in the file like 1-4, we don't have data for april
in the file like 9-12, we collect data from mars to the end of the year

solutions:
merge the data anyway, and delete the lines that appear multiple times
no missing data in this way

the journal le parisien :
the name of the journal is specified to region
already remove that in the file name
